# **"Gen Z's Gym Rat Culture: The Impact of Social Media on Fitness Trends in the Philippines"**

The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the fitness sector, with lockdowns causing gyms to close and many fitness enthusiasts seeking alternatives. As people adapted to their new reality, home exercises and TikTok trends like "quarantine workouts" became popular.

Now, in 2024, the fitness industry has shifted dramatically. Young adults and teenagers influence new trends, particularly in gym culture. This blog delves into how digital trends shapes the gym culture and become more popular or a trend than ever before.

## **The Rise of Gym Rats: A New Era of Fitness**

### Self-Improvement

As a Gen Z fitness enthusiast, I began working out to improve my overall physique, motivated by insecurities about my body. However, along the way, I understood that being fit wasn't just about getting a particular appearance; it was also about accepting myself as I am. I also noticed my unhealthy lifestyle, particularly during the pandemic, when staying inside, which resulted in a sedentary lifestyle centered around playing video games on the internet with friends and spending all my time in front of a computer. I attempted some exercises I saw on TikTok and YouTube, but I found it difficult to continue when I wasn't seeing any results.

## **The Influence of Friends and Social Media**

### The Influence of Friends

I saw that one of my friends (who used to play games with me all day), who began working out during the pandemic, made remarkable gains in improving his overall physique. Our entire friend group was amazed by the outcomes of his commitment. I realized that achieving such goals is not impossible with exemplary commitment. Friend groups and social media have heavily driven the rise in gym culture. It is now usual for friends to encourage one another to exercise together, fostering a strong sense of community and accountability.

### The Influence of Social Media

Social media has transformed how we approach fitness. Fitness influencers share aesthetic workout routine content, gym memes, and expert advice from licensed fitness coaches on proper exercise form and gym equipment usage across various platforms. Due to Gen Z's shorter attention span, thanks to Instagram Reels and TikTok. They are the go-to sources for fitness content because of their brief video formats. These trendy platforms' ability to deliver quick, engaging, and informative videos has significantly changed how people discover and engage with fitness trends.

Many people also create humorous content, like gym memes. One popular trend is the "forbidden pre-workout," where instead of using supplements, people use heartbreak as motivation to push through their workout sets, often by revisiting conversations with an ex or looking at pictures of their ex with a new partner. This trend shows how some use the gym to cope and move on from past relationships.

Another popular trend in the Philippines is the "Bicep trend and Big boy trend," in which videos feature women expressing their admiration for men with big biceps and broad shoulders. Some videos even mention how they love guys who wear polo shirts that fit snugly around their arms. This motivates many men to hit the gym and work on their biceps.

## **Body Dysmorphia**

Meanwhile, while the gym culture has many benefits, it also has downsides, including "body dysmorphia." Because of social media, many people compare themselves to others online—the pressure to achieve the “perfect body” which leads to unhealthy habits. According to Paul S. (2023, July 3), with this mental condition, people spend a lot of time worrying about perceived defects in their bodies. This is also linked to eating disorders, as it frequently results in disordered eating practices.

## Teenagers

Gym culture in the Philippines has started growing, especially among teenagers nowadays, because of social media and the community here in the Philippines. I’m happy to see high school students going to the gym where I go, a stark contrast to the past when many would have spent their time in internet cafés. Before, when I was a high school student, my go-to after dismissal was internet cafés playing games while eating pancit canton. Nowadays, teenagers are increasingly motivated to achieve a healthy, fit physique, driven by the desire for self-improvement and the influence of digital trends.

## Conclusion

However, while this trend brings many positive changes, such as increased physical activity and community engagement, it also has downsides. The pervasive influence of social media can lead to unrealistic body standards and even contribute to issues like body dysmorphia and unhealthy behaviors.

Overall, the rise of gym culture in the Philippines is reflected by both positive and negative influences. As this trend evolves, promoting a balanced exercise approach that focuses on overall well-being rather than appearance is essential.
